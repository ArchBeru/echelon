{"name":"Echelon","tagline":"","body":"Echelon for B3\r\n##################################################################\r\nThis tool is to investigate your playercrowd and see their B3 \r\nhistory. See an overview of their warnings, kicks and (temp)bans. \r\nAlso see which admin is kicking and banning ppl and their reasons \r\nfor doing so.\r\n\r\n\r\nRequirements:\r\n##################################################################\r\n\r\n- Website running php.\r\n- website must have access to your B3 database.\r\n- website must have rcon access to your game.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\n##################################################################\r\n\r\n1. Extract this package into the root of your website! It will \r\ncreate a directory called echelon and a dir called sql.\r\n\r\n2. Create a MySQL database called echelon and a user (echelon) \r\nwith a password (echelonb3) that has access from localhost (if \r\nyour mysql is running on the same machine as your webserver) to \r\nthis database. (Don't forget to flush the privileges)\r\n\r\n3. Execute the echelon.sql script inside the directory 'sql' on \r\nthe echelon database. This will create two tables and a few \r\nrecords.\r\n\r\n4. Open 'Connections/inc_config.php' with your teksteditor and \r\nmake sure the username and password for the b3 database(s) are set \r\ncorrectly.\r\nMultiDB support requires some handywork... editing inc_config.php\r\ncorrectly is very important. This config supplies you with a sample \r\nfor 3 db's.\r\n\r\n5. If your game has PunkBuster support, Echelon has the ability to\r\nwrite to the pbbans.dat file for instant banning and unbanning of \r\nclients. This info can be set per server in b3connect.php.\r\n\r\n6. ONLY IF YOU HAVE CHOSEN A DIFFERENT USERNAME AND/OR PASS UNDER \r\nPOINT 2.: Open wwwvalidate.php with notepad and modify this \r\nconnection so the username and pass match.\r\n\r\n7. Point your browser to http://<yourwebsite>/echelon/index.php \r\n(or whatever the installation path is) and log in with \r\n'admin' and 'admin', change the password for this user, and have \r\na bunch of fun!\r\n\r\n8. You can modify the look and feel of Echelon by modifying the\r\ncss file called default.css inside the css-folder. A few examples\r\nare included in that directory.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpgrade Note:\r\n##################################################################\r\nThis version of Echelon works with B3 v1.1.0+ If you're still using\r\nB3 v1.0.0 you should use the database update as described below:\r\n\r\n- Columns were added to the tables clients and penalties. \r\nTo add these to your existing database, execute the following \r\nMySQL script on your database:\r\n  ALTER TABLE clients ADD password VARCHAR(32),\r\n    ADD login VARCHAR(16);\r\n  ALTER TABLE penalties ADD data VARCHAR(255);\r\n\r\n\r\n##################################################################\r\nxlr8or - www.bigbrotherbot.com // www.xlr8or.com\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
